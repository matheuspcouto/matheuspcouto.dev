        <h3>Matheus Pimentel Do Couto</h3>
        <p>
          A Full-Stack Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience building scalable APIs and web applications using
          Java, Node.js, and Angular. I apply SOLID principles, Clean Code, Hexagonal Architecture, and Domain-Driven
          Design (DDD) to deliver maintainable and high-performance systems in complex enterprise environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          I led the refactoring of over 500 REST APIs at Bradesco Seguros, significantly improving system performance,
          reliability, and maintainability. I also developed financial applications for Bradesco Bank, enhancing
          scalability and supporting thousands of users across Brazil. Additionally, I mentored junior engineers,
          increasing overall team productivity and code quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          My technical stack includes Java, Node.js, Angular, RESTful APIs, CI/CD pipelines, and integration with AI
          agents. I have strong experience redesigning and modernizing applications, including leading the UX/UI
          transformation of the Bradesco Pix app for individuals, delivering improved usability and full user control
          over Pix functionalities. I also developed an award-winning undergraduate project — a web platform for a
          Methodist Church in Palmas — focused on accessibility and inclusive UX, which I continue to evolve while
          managing a small engineering team.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am seeking international opportunities to contribute to global products, collaborate with multicultural
          teams, and drive scalable solutions with measurable impact.
